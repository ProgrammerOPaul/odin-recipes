    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This week on Basics, I'm showing you how to make classic French Toast. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Thick slices of bread (white country loaf, challah, french brioche, or chocolate babka)</li>
        <li>Classic French Toast Custard or Fancy French Toast Custard (see below)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Butter, melted</li>
        <li>Maple syrup, for serving</li>
        <li>Butter, for serving </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by cutting your bread of choice into thick slices. Place onto a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. Leave out overnight uncovered, or preheat the oven to its lowest temperature and place the bread in for 15-20 minutes, flipping halfway through. Either way, your bread should be nice and dry.</li>
        <li>For the classic custard, in a large bowl combine 1 ½ cups of whole milk, 2 large eggs, 3-4 tablespoons of granulated white sugar, 1-2 teaspoons of real vanilla extract, and ½ teaspoon each of ground cinnamon and nutmeg. Whisk together until combined and no streaks of egg remain.  </li>
        <li>For fancy french toast custard, in a large bowl combine 1 ½ cups of half & half or heavy cream, 3-4 egg yolks, 3-4 tablespoons of dark brown sugar, 1-2 teaspoons of vanilla paste or one scraped vanilla bean, ½ teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg, the zest of a lemon or orange, and a splash of either bourbon, rum, or brandy. Whisk together until fully combined. </li>
        <li>Once the custard is ready, pour it into a cake pan or pie plate. Grab a piece of thickly cut bread and drop it into the custard, letting it sit for 20-30 seconds on each side. </li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of melted butter in a non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add the soaked bread to the skillet and let the bread fry for 3-5 minutes on each side, until golden brown. </li>
        <li>Place onto a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet in a 350°F oven while you cook all of the pieces.</li>
        <li>Once every piece of toast is complete, stack on a plate, topped with butter and maple syrup. </li>
        <li>For a tangy butter for the chocolate babka, whip together 8 ounces of room temperature cream cheese with 3 tablespoons of sugar and a pinch of salt.</li>
    </ol>
