    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fun Fact: Shrimp Scampi is an amalgamation of 
        many different traditional Italian preparations of
        scampi (otherwise known as langoustines, Dublin Bay prawns, 
        or Norway Lobsters). Therefore, there isn’t one correct way i
        n which to make it. Try swapping out the pasta in our recipes for rice, or even 
        just a loaf of crusty bread.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tsp kosher salt (+ more to taste) </li>
        <li>½ lb linguine pasta </li>
        <li>3 Tbsp unsalted butter </li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil </li>
        <li>3 garlic cloves, crushed </li>
        <li>¼ tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>½ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 lb frozen shrimp, defrosted and peeled</li>
        <li>1 tsp freshly ground black pepper </li>
        <li>Juice of 1 large lemon </li>
        <li>2 Tbsp parsley, chopped </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Fill a large pot ⅔  the way full with water and add 2 teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat the butter and olive oil over medium-high heat in a large skillet.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Once the butter is fully melted, add the crushed garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Add the pasta to the boiling water and cook until al dente according to the instructions on the box. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Add the wine to the skillet and cook until reduced by half, about 3-5 minutes. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Add the shrimp and cook on each side for about 45 seconds to 1 minute.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Add the lemon juice and stir to incorporate. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Drain the pasta, but reserve ¼ cup of the water.</li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Add the pasta to the skillet and stir to combine. If the sauce looks separated, add the reserved pasta water. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li>Season to taste and garnish with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
